# Blazor MAUI Hybrid App
## .NET 9 EF Core SQLite
### Local SQLite EF Core template for Windows and Android

This is just a basic **CRUD** application template.
I couldn't find documentation on how to setup a local SQLite
database while compiling to both Windows and Android (or others)
from one project. This deals with filepath management,
.db file deployment and design time migrations.
